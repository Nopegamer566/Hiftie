            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">So I Finally decided to join Ironman too. For those who don't know what
                Ironman is, Basicly Ironman is a gamemode with heavy limitations, making the gameplay much
                more difficult. The user can choose Ironman mode when creating a new profile. This mode can be created
                as Co-ops and members share collections as they do normally. So make sure to Subscribe my Channel to
                never get
